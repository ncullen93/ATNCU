This code relies on the "Automated Biomarker Analysis" (ABA) package which makes it easy to test biomarker combinations across different outcomes and clinical groups. ABA also provides model selection algorithms and great visualization capabilities. Please email me at nicholas.cullen@med.lu.se to obtain access to the ABA package - it is available to all qualified investigators and researchers.
